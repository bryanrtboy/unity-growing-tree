# Growing tree

This fork adds the ability to draw a cloud of leaves using the mouse to draw a blob mesh shape. Leaves can then be added to the tree, growing additional branches.

This code is a follow-up to the article I wrote on my blog: [https://ciphered.xyz/2019/09/11/generating-a-3d-growing-tree-using-a-space-colonization-algorithm/](https://ciphered.xyz/2019/09/11/generating-a-3d-growing-tree-using-a-space-colonization-algorithm/).

If you want details on the algorithm, please check the article.
